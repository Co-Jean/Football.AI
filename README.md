# Football.AI

## About
Football.AI is a personal experimentation with genetic algorithm based 
neural networks. It simulates simple games of American or "Gridiron" football, 
implementing both offensive and defensive teams. Every team is made of players
each with their own network making decisions. Every generation, several teams
play each other and only the best performing may stay.
